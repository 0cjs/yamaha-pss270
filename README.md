# Yamaha PSS-270

This repo contains my work on reverse-engineering, hacking, modifying and upgrading the Yamaha PSS-270 portable electronic "toy" keyboard.

My goal is to outfit the device with various modern features, including but not limited to:

* MIDI in and out capability, with ability to control all functions of the device
* USB sound output capability (a USB sound device that appears as a "mic" to a PC)
* Rechargeable Li-Ion batteries
* Direct access to the OPL chip (e.g. use the keyboard as an external OPL synth)
* And more...

This repository will archive documentation and code that I find and write to further this effort.
